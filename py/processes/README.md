The directory where this file is located will be used to store
process-related files. For each process, the following files will be
created:

- `process_ID.dat`: a pickle file with the relevant parameters
- `process_ID.log`: a log file associated to the process
- `process_ID_cache1.fits`: the cached science field data, as a binary
   FITS table
- `process_ID_cache2.fits`: the cached control field data, as a binary
   FITS table
- `process_ID.fits`: the final maps, as a multi-plane FITS file
